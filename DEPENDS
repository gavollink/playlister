    libxml2
    uthash

uthash is found here:
  https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/
  git clone https://github.com/troydhanson/uthash.git

Uthash can be cloned into the root of playlister, or it can be
softlinked into there from someplace else.


OPTIONAL

The default randomizer isn't very random, which can make the output of the
random files predictable in certain situations.  
Use arc4random (preferred) or sranddev.
