TODO LIST

 Lots and lots of testing, expected bug fixes.

Post 1.0 Future TODO list
 Create a functionality to auto-generate a config file.

CHANGES:

Version: 1.01.48:
-- Running with "-v" will show all Playlist names in the source xml
file.  Also showing all songs now requies "-v -v"
-- Playlists convert to filenames, now Playlist name characters that
are not filename safe are removed from the filename.  This could lead
to awkward names, especially if UTF-8 characters are used.
If this is a problem for YOUR use case, e-mail me, and I'll add a
"translate" configuration option to be able to add from/to, but
if nobody emails, I'll assume that I'm the only one who uses this.

Version: 1.00.47.1:
README and README.md updates.
Makefile now includes "configure.h" (or copies it from CONFIGURE.h)
Now has --help_config to describe a sample configuration file

Version: 1.00.47:
Readme changes, move from SubVersion to Git, functionality the same.

Version: 0.6:
Add feature to verify playlist output filenames and recover if the only
difference is cAsE.  If the file cannot be found, it will not appear
in the playlist output.

Version: 0.5:
Support for extended m3u output.
Changes to verbose outputs to help testing and --help output.

Version: 0.4
(( Revision 38 ))
First public release.
